# A german keymap for the Ferris Sweep keyboard 
## For QMK using the Colemak-DH layout

This is my current keymap for my Ferris Sweep intended for typing primarly in english as the base layout is based on colemak-dh.
Nevertheless it allows for unproblematic typing in german.
I've opimized a layer for brackets and other special characters for programming.
